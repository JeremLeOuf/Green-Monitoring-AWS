# Green-Monitoring-AWS
Green Cloud Monitoring - my Cloud Computing project for my second semester @ HTW Berlin

## Note:
To successfully run this app, you need to [request an API key from ElectricityMaps](https://www.electricitymaps.com/get-our-data) and add an environment variable to the configuration of your Lambda function on AWS, which should be a key-value pair: the key should be `ELECTRICITYMAP_API_KEY` and the value should be your ElectricityMaps API key.

### Feel free to contribute to this project!
